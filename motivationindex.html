            <p1>Learning how to stay motivated is a very essential aspect in this journey.<br>
             Long breaks with art will not fullfill our wish to become a great artist, therefore here are a few ways you can keep yourself motivated!</p1>
             <h2>1) Schedule your art time!</h2>
             <img src="C:\Users\LENOVO\Documents\Shimul\images\schedule.jpg" class="schedule"><br>
             <br><p2>Remember the times when you were in no mood to have art time? This is the solution to that, this may sound cliche but try scheduling a comfortable<br>
                 time for yourself and the moment the time strikes the clock, be ready with your supplies, you can find inspiration before hand and continue with your work jubiliantly!</p2>
                 <h2> 2) Seek input from others</h2>
                 <img src="C:\Users\LENOVO\Documents\Shimul\images\input.jpg" class="input"><br>
                 <br><p2>Whenever you feel like quitting, don't forget to have a nice little talk with your loved ones, they will advice you, it will keep you motivated and strong from within. <br>
                     You can always ask for appreciation and encouragement, because that's what we artists want! ðŸ˜‰</p2>
                     <h2>3) Revisit your favourite artists</h2>
                     <img src="C:\Users\LENOVO\Documents\Shimul\images\artist.png" class="artist"><br>
                     <br><p1>This will create nostalgic memories in your head, it will help you find more about the artist and also would be prudent to find inspiration,
                          if you have lost track, then you can begin to follow the artist again reviving your skills and motivation.</p1>
                          <h2>4) Incorporate inspirational wall decor</h2>
                          <img src="C:\Users\LENOVO\Documents\Shimul\images\walldecor.jpg" class="walldecor"><br>
                          <br><p1>When you keep looking at the wall whenever you enter your room, it will remind you of your duties toward your hobbies, <br>
                              this hack is very helpful for the ones who have lost the connection with art.</p1>
    
                            <h2>5) Make money with your Art!</h2>
                            <img src="C:\Users\LENOVO\Documents\Shimul\images\money.jpg" class="money"><br>
                            <br><p1>Who can stop you from accomplishing your endevours, if the reason behind it is money ðŸ¤‘. This will create a urge to make art,<br> 
                                which is beneficial financially and independently. If you believe in making your carrier in art, then this hack is the best.</p1><br>
