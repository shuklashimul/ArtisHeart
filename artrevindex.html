        <p1> Just like any other revolution, our art industry has Art Revolutions, Let's look through them! A
            part from these we also have subtopics such as still life, mordern art, portraits and landscape (discussed in the Beginner page)</p1>
        <h2> Realism or Hyper-Realism </h2>
        <img src="C:\Users\LENOVO\Documents\Shimul\images\real.png " class="real"><br>
        <br><p2> Realism was an artistic movement that emerged in France in the 1840s, around the 1848 Revolution.
             Realists rejected Romanticism, which had dominated French literature and art since the early 19th century. 
             Realism revolted against the exotic subject matter and the exaggerated emotionalism and drama of the Romantic movement. 
            Instead, it sought to portray real and typical contemporary people and situations with truth and accuracy, and not avoiding unpleasant or sordid aspects of life. 
            Realism art has less to do with the photorealistic painting of images and has more to do with the realistic subject matter.  </p2>
            <h2> Cubism </h2>
            <img src=" C:\Users\LENOVO\Documents\Shimul\images\cubewinnie.jpg" class= "cubewinnie"><br>
            <br><p2> Cubism is an early-20th-century avant-garde art movement that revolutionized European painting and sculpture, and inspired related movements in music, literature and architecture. 
                In Cubist artwork, objects are analyzed, broken up and reassembled in an abstracted form—instead of depicting objects from a single viewpoint, the artist depicts the subject from a multitude of viewpoints to represent the subject in a greater context.
                 Cubism has been considered the most influential art movement of the 20th century.</p2>
                 <h2> Surrealism</h2>
                 <img src="C:\Users\LENOVO\Documents\Shimul\images\surreal.jpg" class="surreal"><br>
                 <br><p2> Surrealism was a cultural movement which developed in Europe in the aftermath of World War I and was largely influenced by Dada.
                      The movement is best known for its visual artworks and writings and the juxtaposition of distant realities to activate the unconscious mind through the imagery. 
                      Artists painted unnerving, illogical scenes, sometimes with photographic precision, creating strange creatures from everyday objects,
                       and developing painting techniques that allowed the unconscious to express itself.</p2>
                       <h2> Mordernism</h2>
                       <img src="C:\Users\LENOVO\Documents\Shimul\images\mordernist.jpg" class="mordernist"><br>
                       <br><p2>Modernism, in the fine arts, a break with the past and the concurrent search for new forms of expression. 
                           Modernism fostered a period of experimentation in the arts from the late 19th to the mid-20th century, particularly in the years following World War I. In the visual arts the roots of Modernism are often traced back to painter Édouard Manet, 
                           who, beginning in the 1860s, broke away from inherited notions of perspective, modeling, and subject matter.</p2><br>
