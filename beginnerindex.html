                       <br><br><h2><b>1) Geometrical shapes</b></h2>
                        <p1> As a beginner your first step should be understanding shapes and sizes.
                             Once you do that and achieve experties then you will be able to draw simple drawings effortlessly.<br>

                             <br><br><h2><b>2) A sense of colours </b></h2>
                             <p1> Before you step into your art world you will need to know about colours and their significance, it's not just the old primary and secondary colours, 
                                 the sense of colours in your painting makes it look slick and chic, 
                                 these basic elements in an art piece are often neglected even though they are vital.<br>

                             <br><br><h2><b>3) Drawings and scenes </b></h2>
                             <p1> When you are well versed in Geometrical shapes, now you will implement 
                                 your study by practicing to draw the simplest of objects and completing them by using colour pencils,oil pastels, crayons etc.<br>

                                        <br><h2><b>4) Sketching</b></h2>
                                        <p1> Sketching will allow you to study human anatomy, this can include portraits, landscapes and still life. 
                                            It will give you deep insights into lighting and depths, this requires a lot of practice and will.<br>

                                        <br><h2><b>5) Water color painting</b></h2>
                                        <p1> Once you are done with sketching, water colour painting is your new forte,
                                             start by painting simple drawing with the best of your ability, and then gradually grab huge projects.<br>
                                            <br><img src= "C:\Users\LENOVO\Documents\Shimul\images\waterpainting.jpg" class="waterpainting"></p1>
    
                                            <br><h2><b>6) Oil Painting </b></h2>
                                            <p1> Oil Painting is very different than it sounds, you need to use the thick paint profusely to blend the colours and to make your painting look up to the mark, you will start by painting on a small canvas and gradually move to bigger projects, the completion of a oil painting takes time, 
                                                due to the meticulous details and the immaculate structure. You need a lot of guidance while working with it. I prefer beginners to start with silhouttes.<br>
                                               <br><img src= "C:\Users\LENOVO\Documents\Shimul\images\oilpainting.jpg" class="oilpainting"></p1>
    
                                               <br><h2><b>7) Keep practicing!</b></h2>
                                               <p1> When you are done with all these steps, you need to work on your weaknesses, because there is always scope to improve.
                                                    Practicing and experimenting new things will slowly start defining your style, 
                                                   you will understand your forte and move toward it.This means you have intrest,experience and love towards art!<br>
