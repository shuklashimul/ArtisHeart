        <h1> INDIAN ART </h1>
    </header>
    <body style="background-color:plum ; color: #6F256F; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">
        <p1> Indian art consists of a variety of art forms, including painting, sculpture, pottery, and textile arts such as woven silk. 
            On its way to modern times, Indian art has had cultural influences, 
            as well as religious influences such as Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism and Islam.</p1>
            <h2>1) Madhubani Painting</h2>
            <img src="C:\Users\LENOVO\Documents\Shimul\images\madhubani.jpg" class= "madhubani"><br>
            <br><p2>Madhubani painting, also referred to as Mithila Art (as it flourishes in the Mithila region of Bihar), is characterized by line drawings filled in by bright colours and contrasts or patterns. This style of painting has been traditionally done by the women of the region, though today men are also involved to meet the demand. These paintings are popular because of their tribal motifs and use of bright earthy colours. 
                These paintings are done with mineral pigments prepared by the artists. The work is done on freshly plastered or a mud wall.</p2>
                <h2> 2) Tanjore Art </h2>
                <img src="C:\Users\LENOVO\Documents\Shimul\images\tanjore.jpeg" class= "tanjore"><br>
                <br><p1>Folk art is linked with the forgotten art of story telling. Paintings are used to depict the visual counterpoint in narration in every region of India. Art forms of Rajasthan, Gujarat and Bengal narrate the myths and legends of local heroes and deities and construct a kaleidoscopic image of our glorious past and rich cultural heritage. Each work is a complete narration in itself, 
                    giving us a glimpse of the past, which has been kept alive by talent and devotion of our artists.</p1>
                    <h2>3) Warli Folk Painting</h2>
                    <img src="C:\Users\LENOVO\Documents\Shimul\images\warli.jpg" class= "warli"><br>
                    <br><p1>Maharashtra is known for its Warli folk paintings. 
                        Warli is the name of the largest tribe found on the northern outskirts of Mumbai, in Western India. 
                        Despite being in such close proximity of the largest metropolis in India, 
                        Warli tribesmen shun all influences of modern urbanization. Warli Art was first discovered in the early seventies. While there are no records of the exact origins of this art, its roots may be traced to as early as the 10th century A.D. Warli is the vivid expression of daily and social events of the Warli tribe of Maharashtra, used by them to embellish the walls of village houses. This was the only means of transmitting folklore to a populace not acquainted with the written word. 
                        This art form is simple in comparison to the vibrant paintings of Madhubani.</p1>
                        <h2>4) Rajasthani Miniature Painting</h2>
                        <img src="C:\Users\LENOVO\Documents\Shimul\images\mini.jpg" class= "mini"><br>
                        <br><p1>The art of Miniature painting was introduced to the land of India by the Mughals, who brought the much-revealed art form from Persia. In the sixteenth century, 
                            the Mughal ruler Humayun brought artists from Persia, who specialized in miniature painting. The succeeding Mughal Emperor, Akbar built an atelier for them to promote the rich art form. These artists, on their part, trained Indian artists who produced paintings in a new distinctive style, inspired by the royal and romantic lives of the Mughals.
                             The particular miniature produced by Indian artists in their own style is known as Rajput or Rajasthani miniature</p1>
                             <h2>Mandala Art</h2>
                             <img src="C:\Users\LENOVO\Documents\Shimul\images\mandala.jpg" class= "mandala"><br>
                             <br><p1>A mandala, which is Sanskrit for “circle” or “discoid object,” is a geometric design that holds a great deal of symbolism in Hindu and Buddhist cultures. 
                                 While extraordinary as a standalone work of art,
                                  mandalas hold symbolic and meditative meaning beyond their vibrant appearance.</p1><br>
