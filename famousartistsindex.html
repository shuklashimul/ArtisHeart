                        His works are one of the best examples of the fusion of European academic art with a purely Indian sensibility and iconography.</p2>
                        <h3> YASHODA AND KRISHNA</h3>
                        <img src="C:\Users\LENOVO\Documents\Shimul\images\Yashodakanha.jpg" class= "Yashodhakanha"><br>

                             <br><p3> Vincent Willem van Gogh (30 March 1853 – 29 July 1890) was a Dutch post-impressionist painter who posthumously became one of the most famous and influential figures in the history of Western art.
                                  In a decade, he created about 2,100 artworks, including around 860 oil paintings, most of which date from the last two years of his life. </p3>
                                  <h3> THE STARRY NIGHT </h3>
                                  <br><img src= "C:\Users\LENOVO\Documents\Shimul\images\starrynight.jpg" class= "starrynight"><br>

                                      Painted in June 1889, it depicts the view from the east-facing window of his asylum room at Saint-Rémy-de-Provence,
                                       just before sunrise, with the addition of an imaginary village.</p3>
                                       <h2> Pablo Picasso</h2>
                                       <img src="C:\Users\LENOVO\Documents\Shimul\images\pp.jpg" class= "pp"><br>
                                       <br><p3> Pablo Ruiz Picasso (25 October 1881 – 8 April 1973) was a Spanish painter, sculptor, printmaker, ceramicist and theatre designer who spent most of his adult life in France.
                                            Regarded as one of the most influential artists of the 20th century, he is known for co-founding the Cubist movement, 
                                            the invention of constructed sculpture, the co-invention of collage, and for the wide variety of styles that he helped develop and explore.</p3>
                                            <h3> THE WHEEPING WOMAN</h3>
                                            <img src="C:\Users\LENOVO\Documents\Shimul\images\thewheepingwoman.jpg" class="ww"><br>
                                           <br> <p3> The Weeping Woman series is regarded as a thematic continuation of the tragedy depicted in Picasso's epic painting Guernica.
                                                 In focusing on the image of a woman crying, the artist was no longer painting the effects of the Spanish Civil War directly,
                                                  but rather referring to a singular universal image of suffering. </p3>
                                                  <h2>Leonardo Da Vinci</h2>
                                                  <img src="C:\Users\LENOVO\Documents\Shimul\images\ldv.jpg" class="ldv"><br>
                                                  <br><p3>Leonardo da Vinci (15 April 1452 – 2 May 1519) was an Italian polymath of the High Renaissance who was active as a painter, draughtsman, engineer, scientist, theorist, sculptor and architect.
                                                       While his fame initially rested on his achievements as a painter, he also became known for his notebooks, 
                                                       in which he made drawings and notes on a variety of subjects, including anatomy, astronomy, botany, cartography, painting, and paleontology.</p3>
                                                       <h3> THE LAST SUPPER</h3>
                                                       <img src="C:\Users\LENOVO\Documents\Shimul\images\ls.jpg " class= "ls"><br>
                                                       <br><p3> The work is assumed to have been started around 1495–96 and was commissioned as part of a plan of renovations to the church and its convent buildings by Leonardo's patron Ludovico Sforza, Duke of Milan. 
                                                           The painting represents the scene of the Last Supper of Jesus with his apostles, as it is told in the Gospel of John,
                                                           Leonardo has depicted the consternation that occurred among the Twelve Apostles when Jesus announced that one of them would betray him.</p3><br>
